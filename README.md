#INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Place any of the .txt files inside /Steam/steamapps/common/Garry's Mod/garrysmod/data/expression2/. 
Ingame, take out the E2 tool, select the file you want, spawn a chip, and it should spawn the relevant weapon for you.

If it doesn't work then... I unno, get better at the game?
