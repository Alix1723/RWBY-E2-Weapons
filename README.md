#INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Make sure you have Wiremod installed and up to date!

Place any of the .txt files inside /Steam/steamapps/common/Garry's Mod/garrysmod/data/expression2/. 

Once in-game, take out the E2 tool, select the file you want, spawn a chip, and it should spawn the relevant weapon for you.

Alternatively, you can use the Git client of your choice and clone the repository to your expression2 folder, which should work in theory.
